 * silently. They part company on empty values only, which an optional column

 * function existed because Ajv compiles through `new Function()`, which the
 * Cloudflare Workers isolate refuses (#317) — this app has run on Railway/Node
 * since, so the constraint is gone. The two agree on empty values as well as on
 * shape: Payload's built-in `json` validator skips `null`, `undefined`, `[]`
 * and `{}` exactly as the old `isEmpty` guard did
 * (`payload/dist/fields/validations.js`).
