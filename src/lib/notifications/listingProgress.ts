/**
 * A listing-quality report projected into what the reminder email shows.
 *
 * The email's counterpart to `buildPanelModel` — same registry, same
 * `detail ?? description` precedence, so a manager reading the email and a
 * manager reading the admin panel are told the same thing in the same words.
 * It differs in splitting the checks by verdict rather than ordering one list:
 * the email leads with what's left to do, closes with what's already done, and
 * the counts drive a progress bar.
 *
 * **`null` means the listing was never checked** (unpublished, finished,
 * expired, trashed) and the email says nothing at all. That is emphatically not
 * a complete listing, which comes back with `open: []` and earns the "nothing
 * to improve" note — so the two have to stay distinguishable here. (An earlier
 * cut collapsed them, correctly, back when both rendered nothing.)
 *
 * Labels are **English**: the verification email is English-only and staying
 * that way (#610 was dropped). Resolving them here rather than in the template
 * is still the right seam — the stable `key` travels with each item, so this is
 * the one function that would need a translations lookup if that ever changes.
