 * The `canonical.verification` contract — what the CMS itself has confirmed
 * about the embed an operator nominated, and the ladder that takes a repeatedly
 * broken one out of service.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect free: the JSON Schema types + validates the column, and
 * {@link nextVerificationState} is the whole state machine. Nothing here loads a
 * page, reads a request, or touches Payload — so the three-strikes rule, the
 * `inconclusive` exemption and the backoff are unit-testable on their own.
 *
 * **Why the server attests rather than the widget** (#633 follow-up): the report
 * endpoint is reachable by anyone holding a published key from an allowed
 * origin. If a public canonical URL were shaped by what a client *reported*, a
 * forged report could reshape it. So a report only ever nominates a candidate;
 * `verified` below — written solely by the verification job from what it
 * observed on the live page — is what a canonical URL may be built from.
