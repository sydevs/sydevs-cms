/**
 * Listing-quality checks for Atlas events (#609).
 *
 * A registry of named checks that flag an event listing as incomplete or
 * low-quality, exposed as a report on the document and rendered in the admin
 * edit view by `EventQualityPanel`. **Advisory only** — nothing here blocks
 * publishing, hides an event, or gates the Verify action.
 *
 * Lives in `src/lib/` rather than `src/collections/Events/` because the
 * collection, the admin panel and the reminder emails all consume it.
