/**
 * GET /api/lectures/for-audience
 *
 * Returns a feed of lectures whose attached audiences overlap the supplied
 * `audiences` ID list. Items with empty `audiences` are always excluded.
 *
 * Lectures with `priority > 0` are always returned before the normal
 * random pool. Within the pinned group, lectures are sorted by priority
 * descending; ties are randomised. The normal pool (priority ≤ 0) preserves
 * the existing uniform-random behaviour.
 *
 * Audience eligibility is **not** evaluated here — clients are expected to
 * call `/api/audiences/for-user` once to resolve their eligible audience
 * IDs and pass the result back as the `audiences` query param. Splitting
 * the rule eval out keeps this endpoint cacheable behind Cloudflare's edge
 * (see #340).
 *
 * Response shape: `{ docs: LecturePlayerData[] }`. Subtitles are returned as
 * the full `{ [locale]: url }` map merged from NV metadata and per-locale
 * entries on the lecture's own `subtitles` array.
