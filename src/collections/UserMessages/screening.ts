/**
 * What screening recorded about a user message, and how it reads.
 *
 * A leaf module, for the same reason as `EventSubmissions/screening.ts`: the
 * job writes this shape and the admin banner renders it, and neither imports
 * the other (the job pulls DNS and the mailer; the banner is a client
 * component).
 *
 * **The job writes the sentences, not the component.** Screening is the only
 * party that knows *why* it decided what it did — which check matched, how many
 * prior messages it counted — so it composes the whole note. The enums are
 * still stored for triage and querying; they are simply not what gets rendered.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* shared with `EventSubmissions/screening.ts`. The two
 * intakes overlap on one step (the email verdict) and the wording does not
 * survive the move: an event submission's note ends "…and check this event is
 * real", which is meaningless for a message somebody sent us. Sharing the enum
 * would have forced sharing the copy, and the copy is the part that has to be
 * about the domain.
 */

/**
 * Why a message was refused, or `ok`. One reason — the first check that hit.
 *
 * A runtime list as well as a type, because the verdict is read back out of a
 * JSON column: `ScreenUserMessages` restores a stored result on a retry, and a
 * value that isn't one of these means the column holds something this code did
 * not write.

 * write-time validator, so the shape has one definition instead of a hand-kept
 * type alias beside a column that accepted anything.
 *
 * Closed (`additionalProperties: false`) because only `ScreenUserMessages`
 * writes here — an unknown key is a bug in the job, not an older server meeting
 * a newer client. `verdict` takes its enum from {@link MESSAGE_VERDICTS}, so the
 * runtime list and the stored contract cannot drift.
 *
 * Raw JSON Schema rather than Zod, and named rather than inline: `verdict` is a
 * bare `enum` spliced from that const array, which is where it belongs.
