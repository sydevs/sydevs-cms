/**
 * EventSubmissions — the intake for community contributions to the Atlas map:
 * anonymous visitors submit **new events** or **update proposals for an
 * existing event** through the Atlas widget, which POSTs the built-in create
 * endpoint with its client key.
 *
 * A submission is a **proposal to judge, not a document to edit**. It carries
 * one `proposed` patch keyed by real Events field names — no mirrored schema,
 * no translation layer — and the review view renders that patch three ways: the
 * diff against the target (`proposedChanges`), the resulting listing
 * (`previewEvent`, via live preview), and Accept / Reject. The only editable
 * fields are `region` — screening can fail to resolve one, and a reviewer has
 * to be able to fix it before accepting — and `manager`, which adopts a
 * created event in the same act. Both apply to new events only.
 *
 * `event` set ⇒ update proposal (and, after acceptance of a new-event
 * submission, the created event). `event` unset ⇒ new event.
 *
 * Guard rails around the public intake:
 * - the write-guard plugin (Turnstile header, URL scan, disposable-email list)
 *   runs beforeValidate on client creates, and `validateProposal` rejects any
 *   `proposed` key that isn't a proposable Events field;
 * - clients hold **create only** — the collection is RESTRICTED (see
 *   `@/plugins/access/config/projects.ts`), so no implicit read ever exposes
 *   submitter emails through the public client key;
 * - the async ScreenEventSubmissions job then classifies spam (MX lookup +
 *   list re-check), resolves the region, and notifies the responsible manager.
