 * by the hundred and never look at the result:
 *
 * - **list reads** (`findMany`) — 25 rows would mean 25 extra queries to render
 *   a list that shows the stored `qualityOpenCount` instead;
 * - **system writes** (`req.context.skipVerifyHook`) — the marker the Atlas
 *   importer and the ExpireEvents job already set on their own writes. Payload
 *   runs `afterRead` on the document an `update` returns, so a 500-event import
 *   would otherwise pay a query per event for a report nothing reads.

 * documented for `computeLastDate` in `src/collections/AGENTS.md`. Computing
