/**
 * The bound on `submissionData` — the plugin's `[{ field, value }]` array,
 * which holds the free-form remainder of a submission.
 *
 * **Why a hook and not a `jsonSchema`.** `submissionData` is not a JSON column;
 * it is a Payload array field, and its `value` is a `textarea`. So the guard
 * every other blob on this collection gets from Ajv has to be written out
 * here — and it has to be written out *per type*, because a contact row's
 * legitimate keys are whatever its form's author named, and a registration
 * row's are the event's enabled questions.
 *
 * **Why bound it at all.** The array is client-writable as one blob, so
 * field-level access cannot protect anything inside it, and Payload cannot pair
 * `field`/`value` conditions on one array element — so nothing queryable may
 * live here, and nothing unbounded may either. Without this check a caller
 * chooses both the keys and their sizes on a public endpoint.
 *
 * Everything in this module is pure, so the whole matrix is testable in the
 * unit lane without booting Payload.
