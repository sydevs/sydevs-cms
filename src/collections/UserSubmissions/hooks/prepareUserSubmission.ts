/**
 * beforeValidate (create): everything the request itself knows, plus the two
 * things that need the database.
 *
 * **beforeValidate, not beforeChange**, unlike the hooks it replaces. The
 * allowed-key check has to refuse a bad blob with a 400 *at the collection*,
 * and the per-type `form` validator has to see a `type` that is already
 * settled — both run before `beforeChange` would. The write-guard plugin
 * prepends its own `beforeValidate`, so the captcha, URL scan and
 * disposable-email list are already behind us when this runs.
 *
 * What it owns:
 *
 * - **`submissionData` is bounded per type.** The blob is client-writable as
 *   one value, so nothing inside it is protected by field access; the keys a
 *   type accepts are the base context set, the type's own, and whatever the
 *   authored form declares. A rejection names the offending key.
 * - **`uuid` is issued here**, for every type. It was `randomUUID()` inline at
 *   the one endpoint that created a registration, which is why nothing else
 *   could create one — a `required` column with no default and no hook refuses
 *   every writer that forgets it.
 * - **`client` comes from the authenticated key, never the body.** It brands
 *   the emails sent about the submission, so a caller able to set it could
 *   attribute its rows to another service. The field's access already refuses
 *   a client write; this is the positive half of the same rule.
 * - **the sender is upserted into `users`** from the normalized address, for
 *   every type — which is what makes a sender's history one history across all
 *   four intakes, and what `Users.submissions` joins on.
 * - **`subject` is composed**, never taken from the body: it names the row in
 *   the admin list, and a submitter titling their own row would put unreviewed
 *   text there.
 * - **a client-created row always starts at `pending`** (belt-and-braces with
 *   the field-level access lockdown).
 *
 * ⚠ **Create only, so every bound here is a create-time bound.** The key
 * allow-list, the URL scan and the length caps do not run on an update. No
 * client holds update, so the only writer that reaches an existing row is a
 * manager or a job — but that does mean `submissionData` is unbounded from the
 * moment the row exists, and a manager editing one is trusted rather than
 * checked. Widening this to `update` is Phase 2's business, alongside the jobs
 * that will write these rows.
