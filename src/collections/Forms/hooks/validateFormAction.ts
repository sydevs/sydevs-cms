 * The rule is per-action, so it cannot live on a field: `required: true` on
 * `client` would demand one from a contact form too, and no `validate` on the
 * `fields` blocks array can see `actionType`.
 *
 * **Why save time and not submit time.** A subscribe form with no email field
 * collects nothing a subscription can be made from, and a contact form with no
 * message body collects nothing to deliver. Both fail on every submission,
 * one visitor at a time, with the author never seeing it. Refusing the save is
 * the only moment the person who can fix it is present.
 *
 * Note `message` is *not* a message field: the plugin's `message` block is
 * static rich text the author writes, not an input the visitor fills.
