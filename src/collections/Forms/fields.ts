 * The `forms` field list, as `formOverrides.fields` hands it to us.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *
 * 1. **Strip `emails`.** The plugin's own `sendEmail` afterChange hook fires on
 *    create, before anything screens the submission, and sends through the raw
 *    `payload.sendEmail` rather than this repo's branded React Email templates.
 *    Removing the field is what disables it: `form.emails` is then `undefined`,
 *    so `sendEmail` takes its explicit "nothing to send" branch. That is a
 *    structural disable, not a suppression — no `beforeEmail` hook silently
 *    swallows a message anyone authored, because nothing can be authored.
 *    All delivery belongs to the queue (#695 Phase 2).
 * 2. **Add `actionType`** and the two fields conditional on it, so a form
 *    declares what a submission against it *is* rather than leaving that to
 *    whichever client happens to post it.
