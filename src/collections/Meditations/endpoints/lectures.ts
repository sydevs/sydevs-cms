/**
 * GET /api/meditations/:id/related-lectures
 *
 * Returns lectures contextually relevant to a specific meditation, ranked by
 * topical overlap between the meditation's on-screen subtle system nodes
 * (cached on `meditation.subtleSystemNodeWeights`) and each candidate
 * lecture's own `subtleSystemNodes`.
 *
 * Audience eligibility is **not** evaluated here — clients are expected to
 * call `/api/audiences/for-user` once to resolve their eligible audience
 * IDs and pass the result back as the `audiences` query param. Splitting
 * the rule eval out keeps this endpoint cacheable behind Cloudflare's edge
 * (see #340).
 *
 * Query params:
 *   - `audiences` (required, comma-separated IDs) — resolved audience IDs
 *     from `/api/audiences/for-user`. Server dedupes + sorts so equivalent
 *     client requests share an edge-cache key.
 *   - `limit` (required, 1–100)
 *   - `userChoice` (optional int) — if set, expand candidates to lectures that
 *     either carry that userChoice tag OR have positive subtle-system-node
 *     overlap with the meditation. userChoice-tagged lectures are ranked first
 *     as a group (even if zero-weight), followed by the remaining positive-
 *     weight lectures.
 *   - `excludedLectureIds` (optional comma-separated ints) — lectures to
 *     exclude (typically already-watched).
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *   1. Look up the meditation (404 if not found).
 *   2. Read `subtleSystemNodeWeights` from the cache; fall through to an
 *      ad-hoc compute (no persistence — keeps the GET side-effect-free).
 *   3. Find candidate lectures. Without `userChoice`, filter to lectures
 *      whose `audiences` overlap the requested list. With `userChoice`, resolve
 *      positive-weight node slugs → IDs (one bounded query, max 12 rows) and
 *      apply an OR filter: audiences match AND (userChoices contains the ID OR
 *      subtleSystemNodes overlaps positive nodes). Falls back to userChoices-
 *      only when the meditation has no positive-weight nodes.
 *   4. Compute lecture weight = sum of `weights[node.slug]` over each
 *      populated `subtleSystemNodes` entry on the lecture. Drop zero-weight
 *      lectures unless they carry the userChoice tag (#343).
 *   5. Sort in two groups: userChoice-tagged lectures first (weight DESC,
 *      id ASC), then non-userChoice lectures (weight DESC, id ASC).
 *   6. Slice to `limit` and shape into `LecturePlayerData`.
 *   7. If that yields zero playable lectures, fall back to the generic audience
 *      feed (same selection as `/api/lectures/for-audience`). Exclusions still
 *      apply; if they would empty the fallback pool too, they are relaxed as a
 *      last resort so the player always has something to play.
 *
 * Response shape: `RelatedLecturesResponse` — `{ docs, source, relevanceCount }`.
 * `source` is `'relevance'` for the ranked result or `'audience-fallback'` for
 * the feed fallback; `relevanceCount` is the number of leading `docs` that are
 * genuine relevance matches (`docs.length` or `0`). The two extra fields are
 * additive — clients reading only `docs` are unaffected.
