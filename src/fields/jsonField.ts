/**
 * Declares a Payload JSON column: its shape, and the four pieces of metadata
 * that shape implies.
 *
 * Payload's `jsonSchema` is `{ uri, fileMatch, schema }`, and every hand-written
 * site repeated the same string three or four times — an exported
 * `*_SCHEMA_URI`, `fileMatch: [URI]`, `$id: URI`, plus a `title` restating it in
 * PascalCase. No URI is referenced for its own sake: Payload's write validator
 * builds a fresh Ajv per call and validates against `schema` directly, and
 * `configToJSONSchema` reads only `schema` too, so `uri` and `fileMatch` reach
 * nothing but the admin's Monaco editor, which needs them merely unique. All
 * four therefore derive from the title, and the title is the only thing a caller
 * states.
 *
 * `title` is the one that is load-bearing: it names the interface Payload
 * generates into `payload-types.ts`. Renaming a schema's `$id` renames that
 * interface only when `title` is absent, which is why this helper always sets
 * one — the derived URI is then free to change without touching a generated
 * name.
 *
 * Pass a Zod type to declare the shape inline at the field it belongs to. Pass a
 * raw {@link JSONSchema4} where the shape is **assembled as data** — properties
 * built by `Object.fromEntries`, or `enum`s spliced from an exported const
 * array — since round-tripping such a shape through Zod only to convert it back
 * buys nothing.
 *
 * **The whole field, not just its schema, is what this returns.** The two are
 * one decision: a JSON column's `type`, `uri`, `fileMatch`, `$id` and `title`
 * are all fixed the moment its shape is written down, so building the field
 * elsewhere leaves five lines a caller can only get wrong. `jsonField` is
 * therefore the only export here — there is no way to obtain a bare
 * `jsonSchema`, and so no way to attach one to a field that skipped this.

 * the only way to be rid of them.

 * Convert a Zod type to the JSON Schema Payload can use.
 *
 * **The target is chosen for Ajv 8, which is what Payload compiles this object
 * with — not for the `JSONSchema4` type the field is declared as, which never
 * reaches a validator.** Ajv 8 implements draft-07 and carries no draft-04
 * meta-schema. The two spell exclusive bounds differently, and only one of them
 * compiles:
 *
 * ```
 * draft-04  z.number().positive() -> { minimum: 0, exclusiveMinimum: true }
 *           Ajv 8: schema is invalid: data/exclusiveMinimum must be number
 * draft-7   z.number().positive() -> { exclusiveMinimum: 0 }          ok
 * ```
 *
 * A draft-04 target therefore hands the next author a column that fails every
 * save the first time they write `.positive()`, `.gt()` or `.lt()` — and the
 * error names a keyword nobody typed. The two draft-07 forms this changes for
 * shapes already in the tree are both no-ops: `const` where draft-04 emitted a
 * one-element `enum`, and `propertyNames: { type: 'string' }` on a record, since
 * every JSON key is a string. `payload-types.ts` regenerates byte-identically
 * either way.
 *
 * `$schema` is deleted so both overloads emit one shape: a raw {@link JSONSchema4}
 * never carries one, and what Payload stores here is a field's shape rather than
 * a standalone document, so `$id` and `title` are the only metadata that earn
 * their place. It is not a necessity — measured with the delete removed, Ajv 8
 * compiles the schema and `payload-types.ts` regenerates byte-identically.
 * (Under a draft-04 target it *was* necessary — Ajv throws `no schema with key
 * or ref` on a meta-schema it does not carry — which is the trap that made
 * draft-04 look survivable.)
