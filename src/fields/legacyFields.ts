/**
 * Migration-only fields shared by the four Atlas collections (Events,
 * Registrations, Users, Regions). Populated by the Phase 3 importer and
 * dropped in a future migration once the import is verified.
 *
 * - `legacyId` — the source row's integer primary key, indexed for
 *   relationship rewiring and idempotent re-runs.
 * - `legacyData` — the complete raw source record (verbatim), kept for
 *   debugging / re-derivation during and after the import.
 *
 * Returns fresh field objects on each call so the same config object isn't
 * shared — and mutated by Payload's field sanitizer — across collections.
