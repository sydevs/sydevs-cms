/**
 * An **activity log**: what happened to a document and when, in a table a
 * manager can read. Emails sent about it, but also anything else worth a
 * record — a registration created, a listing verified, a booking cancelled.
 *
 * Two logs existed before this and agreed on nothing: the Events verification
 * log was rendered by its own component, the Registrations reminder ledger was
 * invisible; one reset per cycle, one grew forever uncapped; each had its own
 * coercion and membership helper.
 *
 * **Columns are declared here**, on the field, and travel to the renderer in
 * `admin.custom` — the same way `SelectDescription` and `EventQualityPanel` get
 * their config. One table serves a verification cycle and a registrant's mail
 * without either being flattened, because each declares what it shows.
 *
 * Declaring them (rather than deriving them from whatever the entries happen to
 * carry) fixes the order and the headings even when a column is absent from
 * every entry so far — a log that has only ever recorded one kind of event
 * still shows the shape it will grow into. With `columns` omitted the table
 * falls back to deriving them, which keeps a new consumer zero-config.
 *
 * Display is **opt-in, inside `cells`**, and everything else on the entry is
 * machine data. That default is the important one: entries are read back as
 * data — `hasReminderForStage` decides whether to send by reading an entry's
 * stage and recipient — and a verification entry carries ten such fields. With
 * the rule the other way round (every unreserved key is a column) that log
 * rendered a fourteen-column table of raw enum values, which is how this shape
 * was arrived at.
 *
 * **A log is a record, not a query filter.** Nothing can `where` on a JSON
 * column cheaply, so a job that needs to *find* documents still wants a real
 * dated column beside the log — `followUpSentAt` stays exactly for that. The
 * log says what happened; the column is what the sweep selects on.
