/**
 * Configuration + pure helpers for the NotificationPreferences field.
 *
 * `NOTIFICATION_TYPES` is passed to the field component via `admin.custom`
 * (see Managers.ts) — the component renders one row per type and adapts
 * entirely from this config, so adding/removing a type needs no component
 * change. The helpers are pure (no React, no Payload) so they can be reused
 * by the field's `defaultValue`/`validate` and unit-tested directly.
 *
 * ⚠ **Keep this module free of runtime imports.** `NotificationPreferencesField`
 * is a `'use client'` component and value-imports from here, so anything added
 * at the top level lands in an admin browser chunk. The column's `jsonSchema`
 * lives beside its field in `Managers.ts` for that reason — declaring it here
 * would ship `zod` and a `toJSONSchema` call to the browser to describe a shape
 * only the server validates.
