 * retiring a type must not block a save: Payload validates this column on every
 * save of a manager, and the field component spreads an unknown key back, so a
 * closed shape would strand the row rather than let the admin clear it. Saying
 * what the *value* holds costs nothing and is what makes the generated
 * interface usable — `additionalProperties: true` generates
 * `[k: string]: unknown`, which is why every consumer reading
 * `prefs[key]?.method` used to need a hand-written alias to cast to. That alias
 * is the second definition #659 exists to delete.
 *
 * **There are deliberately no per-key `properties`.** They validated exactly
 * what this does, differing only in a `description`, and TypeScript refuses the
 * combination: an optional named property includes `undefined`, which is not
 * assignable to an index signature that does not, so `payload-types.ts` itself
 * fails `tsc` with TS2411. Requiring the four keys would fix the assignability
 * and strand every row missing one. `NOTIFICATION_TYPES` stays the source of
 * truth for which keys the admin renders, and the frequency is checked as a
 * string rather than against `frequencyOptions` — dropping an option would
 * otherwise strand every manager still on it.
