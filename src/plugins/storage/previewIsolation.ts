/**
 * Preview / non-production storage isolation (Cloudflare Images, Stream, R2).
 *
 * Images, Stream, and R2 are account/bucket-scoped resources shared by EVERY
 * deployment of this app: production, Railway per-PR previews, staging, and
 * local dev all talk to the same Cloudflare account + R2 bucket. Cloned preview
 * databases reference real production asset IDs, so without isolation a preview
 * deploy could upload into — or, far worse, DELETE from — the production
 * namespace (issue #432).
 *
 * Strategy ("Option B" — namespacing within the single account):
 *  - Non-production uploads carry a `preview-` marker: an object-ID/key prefix
 *    for Images + R2, and a `meta.env=preview` tag for Stream (whose UIDs are
 *    assigned by Cloudflare, not the caller).
 *  - Non-production deletes are GUARDED — an adapter refuses to delete any asset
 *    that does not carry the marker, so a preview can never destroy a prod asset.
 *  - A scheduled job (`scripts/cleanup-preview-assets.ts`) reaps marked assets.
 *
 * Production is untouched: every helper here is a no-op when
 * `isProductionDeployment()` is true, honouring the "no new code paths in the
 * production data plane" constraint — prod keeps its exact existing behaviour
 * (no prefix, no guard, no extra API calls).
 *
 * See `docs/rules/storage.md` § "Preview / non-production isolation".
