/**
 * `pnpm seed translations`, end to end, for the WeMeditate Web global (#707).
 *
 * The unit spec beside this one (`tests/unit/wm-web-translations-seed.spec.ts`)
 * proves the seed FILE agrees with the schema. It cannot prove the file is
 * accepted: the shape only meets Payload's per-column JSON Schema when the
 * importer hands it over untransformed, and the publish only lands if
 * `localizeStatus` treats `_status` as a per-locale column. Both are database
 * facts.
 *
 * The publish needs asserting **directly**, because nothing else observes it.
 * English is exempt from `availableLocales`'s publish gate — gating the one
 * locale nobody can deselect would deadlock the save — and a global read
 * returns the same document whether `draft` is true, false, or unset. So a
 * publish that silently did nothing would leave every downstream behaviour
 * looking correct, and show up only as wrong state in the admin. These cases
 * read `_status`, rather than inferring it from an effect.
 *
 * It runs the real `TranslationsImporter`, which also seeds the app and atlas
 * globals. That is deliberate: a change breaking one of its siblings breaks
 * `pnpm seed translations` for everyone, and this is the only spec that runs it.
