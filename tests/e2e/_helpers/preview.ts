/**
 * Log in to the preview as the admin and return a JWT.
 *
 * **This is a login and nothing more.** The admin is provisioned by the deploy itself —
 * `onInit` reconciles it from `PREVIEW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` on every boot of a preview
 * environment (`src/plugins/previewAdmin`, sydevs/SahajCloud#662) — so by the time any
 * spec runs, an account matching the current secret already exists.
 *
 * It used to bootstrap the account itself via Payload's `first-register`, which succeeds
 * only while the auth collection is empty. That made the credential a property of the
 * preview *database* rather than of the current secret, and a preview's Postgres volume
 * outlives its deploys: rotating the secret orphaned every already-seeded environment,
 * because login then failed on the new value while `first-register` stayed Forbidden.
 * Reconciling at deploy removes that whole class of failure, and with it the 403
 * special-case this function used to carry.
 *
 * A failure here is therefore a real one — the deploy did not seed, or the secret this
 * run holds is not the one the deploy used — so it is reported rather than worked around.
