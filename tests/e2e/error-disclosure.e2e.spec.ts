/**
 * What the DEPLOYED config discloses — sydevs/SahajCloud#684.
 *
 * **This is the only gate that goes red if `payload.config.ts` is reverted to
 * `debug: true`.** The integration pair (`tests/int/error-disclosure*.int.spec.ts`)
 * pins the *pipeline* — what each value of the flag discloses, and that
 * `databaseErrorPlugin`'s 400 survives either — but both suites pass their own
 * `debug` to `createTestEnvironment`, so neither can observe the app's own
 * setting. This lane can: the Railway PR preview runs `NODE_ENV=production`
 * against the real `payload.config.ts`, so these two requests read the shipped
 * value rather than a fixture's copy of it.
 *
 * ⚠ **These two are the only smoke specs that may skip at all.** They skip when
 * there is no `PREVIEW_URL`, and `failOnSkipReporter` fails the run for any skip
 * once there is one, because the local fallback (`http://localhost:3000`) is
 * a development server where `debug` is on *by design* — a redaction assertion
 * there would be correct and inapplicable at the same time. On the preview both
 * cases are unconditional: a skip would make the check vacuous, which is the one
 * failure mode this file exists to remove.
