"""Run a Payload script on a PTY. This answers drizzle's interactive prompts.

    python3 .claude/skills/payload-cli/interactive.py "<js module source>"

Node evaluates the script with `--input-type=module --import tsx/esm -e`,
from the repo root, so it can `await import('./src/payload.config.ts')`.
A PTY has no separate stdout to inherit, so everything the child writes,
including your own script's output, goes to `/tmp/payload-pty.log`.

**Load `.env` and `.env.local` before you call this.** Otherwise the
config's `serverEnv` check throws, and `payload/bin.js` swallows the error
(`void start()`, with no `.catch()`):

    set -a; . ./.env; . ./.env.local; set +a

Four prompt-handling lessons are built in. Each came from a real hang:

  * Answer once per distinct column, not once per prompt text. The rename
    prompts arrive back to back, and a time-based debounce swallowed the
    second one.
  * Clear that memo at the `Starting migration` phase boundary. Push and
    migration generation ask the same questions. Keying only on text
    answered the first round, then hung on the second.
  * Accept the data-loss warning with `y`. This is correct here: it drives
    a local dev database catching up to a schema change. Production
    applies migrations a different way and never sees this prompt.
  * Match on ANSI-stripped text. chalk colours the column and table names
    on a PTY, so `\\w+` cannot span the escapes sitting inside the prompt.
    The log keeps the raw bytes; only the copy we match on is stripped.

Raw mode needs `\\r`, not `\\n`.

A prompt this driver cannot parse ends the run with exit 3 and the last
200 characters it saw, rather than waiting for the caller's `timeout` to
decide. Exit 124 with an empty log means something else.

Environment overrides:

  * `PAYLOAD_PTY_CWD` — run the child somewhere other than the repo root
    this file sits in, so a patched copy works from anywhere.
  * `PAYLOAD_PTY_STALL_SECONDS` — how long an unanswered question may sit
    silent before the driver gives up. Raise it for a genuinely slow run.

The rename prompt highlights `+ create column` as its default answer. That
choice drops the old column and adds a new one. This is right for a
genuinely new column, but it destroys data on a real rename. Check
`src/migrations/AGENTS.md` before you accept it on a column that holds
rows.
